# TODO: Video Compression Web App Development

## Backend (Django + DRF + FFmpeg)
- [ DONE ] Set up Django project and configure settings
- [ DONE ] Install and configure Django REST Framework (DRF)
- [ DONE ] Integrate DRF Spectacular for API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- [ ] Implement video upload endpoint with Django file handling
- [ ] Configure file storage (Local/AWS S3)
- [ ] Integrate FFmpeg for video compression (H.265 - libx265)
- [ ] Implement single video compression with adjustable settings (CRF, bitrate, preset)
- [ ] Add batch video compression support
- [ ] Expose API endpoints for frontend interaction
- [ ] Set up Celery and Redis for async compression tasks
- [ ] Implement download endpoint with link expiration
- [ ] Secure API with CORS, rate limiting, and authentication (if needed)

## Frontend (Vue.js + Bulma)
- [ ] Initialize Vue 3 project with Vite
- [ ] Set up Vue Router and Pinia (if state management is required)
- [ ] Create a responsive UI using Bulma CSS
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop file upload
- [ ] Display upload progress with validation messages
- [ ] Add compression settings UI (CRF, bitrate, preset selection)
- [ ] Show real-time compression progress
- [ ] Implement download functionality for compressed files
- [ ] Display uploaded/compressed video history (if authentication is enabled)

## Database & Storage
- [ ] Configure PostgreSQL/SQLite for storing video metadata
- [ ] Store uploaded video details and compression settings
- [ ] Implement database cleanup for expired downloads

## Deployment & Optimization
- [ ] Set up Docker and Docker Compose for containerized deployment
- [ ] Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy
- [ ] Deploy backend and frontend to DigitalOcean/AWS
- [ ] Implement background task monitoring with Flower
- [ ] Optimize FFmpeg parameters for best quality-size balance
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement user authentication with Django Auth/JWT
- [ ] Add user dashboard to manage uploaded videos
- [ ] Support additional formats (WebM, MPEG, etc.)
- [ ] Enable cloud-based processing for scalability
- [ ] Improve mobile UI/UX for better experience

# Notes
- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and correctly configured on the server
- Use environment variables for sensitive configurations
